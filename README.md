# Energy Management in Building Facilities

A modular Java application for managing energy, water, lighting, and environmental systems in modern building infrastructures.

## Overview

This project simulates a smart building management system using Java. It includes multiple modules that monitor and control:

- Photovoltaic (solar) panel operations
- HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems
- Power and water consumption
- Lighting and sound systems
- Building security mechanisms

The application is designed with modular logic and is built using **IntelliJ IDEA**.

## Features

✅ Microservice for photovoltaic panel control  
✅ HVAC system monitoring  
✅ Lighting and sound automation  
✅ Water and power usage tracking  
✅ Basic security system simulation  
✅ User-friendly structure and well-organized backend logic

## Technologies Used

- Java (OOP)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Modular architecture design
- Simulated sensors and state management

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /main
    /java
      /controller
      /services
      /model
      /ui
```

> Each package is responsible for a specific functional aspect, promoting separation of concerns and clarity in development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kokonelas/Energy_Management_In_Building_Facilities.git
```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA  
3. Run the main application file  
4. Use the simulated UI to explore each module

## Motivation

This project was developed as part of my academic training to explore how **intelligent building systems** can be designed and managed with software. My goal was to create a practical and modular system that mimics real-world scenarios in building energy management.
